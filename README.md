# termconsole
Terminal console, the console that is in your terminal(I'm not joking).

# How to get maximum performance
Compile it yourself. Just download the rust toolkit on your system and run `cargo build --release`. Then you can find the executable in `target/release/termconsole`. Easy, right?

# System Requirements
- Linux, Mac OS X, or and other Unix-like system(hopefully has rust support)
- Windows 7 or later
